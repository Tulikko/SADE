## How to create course page:

1) Create new repo

2) Open RStudio and create a new project by selecting:
"File" - "New Project" - "Version Control" - "Git"
and paste the web URL in the "Repository URL" box.

3) Create a course diary web page on GitHub

a) Go back to your GitHub repository.

b) Open "Settings" and scroll to "GitHub Pages". From "Source" select "master branch".

c) Refresh the page and wait (might take a few minutes!) until you see the green text "Your site is published..."

Now your course diary web page is online at
your_github_username.github.io/repository_name

```{r}
# code
```
