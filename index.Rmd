This is my course page for the R exercises in the Spatial Analysis and Data Exploration in History and Archaeology course, University of Helsinki, lectured by Eljas Oksanen in Spring 2021.

**How to create a course page:**

You need to have R, RStudio and Git installed and Git linked to your Rstudio before this step.

1) Create a new GitHub repository

2) Open RStudio and create a new project by selecting:
"File" - "New Project" - "Version Control" - "Git"
and paste the web URL in the "Repository URL" box.

3) Create a web page on GitHub:

a) Go back to the GitHub repository.

b) Open "Settings" and scroll to "GitHub Pages". From "Source" select "master branch".

c) Now your course diary web page is online at
github_username.github.io/repository_name

```{r child = "week1/week1.Rmd"}
```

```{r child = "week2/week2.Rmd"}
```

```{r child = "week3/week3.Rmd"}
```

```{r child = "week4/week4.Rmd"}
```

```{r child = "week5/week5.Rmd"}
```
